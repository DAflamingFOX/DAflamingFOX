## About me

I'm currently pursuing an electrical engineering major at Tarleton State University with a minor in computer science.

Currently I am also working with [SWYFT Robotics](https://swyftrobotics.com) as an electrical engineer & software/firmware developer.

I am the sole developer for [Ranger](https://swyftrobotics.com/products/swyft-ranger-distance-sensor), a LIDAR distance sensor,
and co-developer of [CANnect](https://swyftrobotics.com/products/swyft-cannect-wiring-system) and [CANender](https://swyftrobotics.com/products/swyft-canender)
which are designed to help reduce the complexity of CAN bus wiring on FRC robots.

Here of some images of the products I've designed:

I have many more designs, but they're not quite ready yet ;')

I'm an alumni and "mentor" for FIRST Robotics team 7125, [Tigerbotics](https://tigerbotics.org).
When I was a member of Tigerbotics, I was the software/programming lead.
My work with Tigerbotics can be seen on their GitHub organization [here](https://github.com/tigerbotics7125).
